# Open-chat
This is a messaging application built totally from scratch, where users from multiple locations in the globe can join and chat with each other. The special factor in this application is, it translates the message from sending user to the receiving user's choice. Let's say, a user Bob from London is chatting with another user Julia from Germany. Bob prefers to chat in English and Julia prefers to chat in German. So when both of the logs into this application and chats with each other Bob's English messages will be translated to German and will be sent to Julia and Julia's German messages will be translated to English and will be sent to Bob. Currently it supports English (en) and German (de) only, but there is a lot of room for adding other languages.
